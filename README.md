# UCSC-AI-Club
Machine Learning projects I have worked on in the UCSC Artificial Intelligence Club

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Work in Progress! These are the projects I have worked on while participating in the UCSC Artificial Intelligence Club. I am still
currently active in the club, so more projects will be added here. Each project is done using Google Colab, which is a Jupyter
Notebook environment that allows users to write Python code. The notebooks were created by the club leaders and distributed to each member
to work on individually, and each one focuses on a different machine learning algorithm.
